**RSA Algorithm Applications with Focus on Image Encrytpion and Decryption**


Information Security has become a vital issue in digital communication.
Cryptography has emerged as an answer and plays a vital role in data security
systems. This project discusses cryptography analysis and describes the RSA
cryptosystem and its applications. Application include Secure File Transmission
(File Encryption and Decryption) , Digital Image Encryption , Big Data
Protection and Digital Signatures verification .Two keys are generated in RSA,
one key is used for encryption & other key which is only known to
authenticated receiver can decrypt the message. No other key can decrypt the
message. Every communicating party needs just a key pair for communicating
with any number of other communicating parties. But in this project we focus on the primary goal which is Image Encryption using RSA Algorithm.
